How to install FAF-Drugs2?
--------------------------------
Steps 1 to 4 and 7 are REQUIRED, steps 5 and 6 are optional but important.
We assume you do not have OpenBabel and Python packages installed.
Even Python programming language is already installed, you will have to re-compile it after having installed OpenBabel.


1:
In your home directory, uncompress the FAF-Drugs2 package in a Linux shell (tar -xvzf FAFDrugs2.tar.gz).
It creates one directory named "/FAF-Drugs2" containing the subdirectories:
~/bin			Contains Python executables files and modules.
~/extras		Contains the OpenBabel 2.1.1 package.
			This is the directory where you can install OpenBabel and Python programming language. As well, here you
			can deposit and install X-Score and GnuPlot package. In this case, please see sections 5-6.
~/parameters_files	Contains soft and hard generics faf2.param and groups.param that you can customize as you want.
			Note that they must be placed in your working and modified as needed.
~/example		Contains a small generic dataset for running FAF-Drugs2.
~/doc			Contains the UserGuide, X-Score installing procedure and a standard FAF-Drugs2 installing procedure.

IMPORTANT:
Set the executable path for FAF-Drugs2 in your ".bash_profile" or ".cshrc".
For instance, in my ".bash_profile" file I have:
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/home/david/FAFDrugs2/bin:
For ".cshrc", set path = ($path ~/FAFDrugs2/bin)



2: OpenBabel
Check if GCC, G++, g77 and gfortran compilers are installed in your Operating System, maybe,
it could be a possible cause of abnormal compilation of OpenBabel toolkit.
Go to ~/FAFDrugs2/extras/ directory and install the OpenBabel package in a Linux shell as follows:

*    tar -xvzf openbabel.2.1.1.tar.gz
*    cd openbabel.2.1.1
*    ./configure
*    make
Under root permissions
*    make install

3: Python
After downloading Python2.5.2.tar.gz, in the extra directory or in your home directory install the Python
programming language package in a Linux shell as follows:

*    tar -xvzf Python-2.5.2.tgz
*    cd Python-2.5.2
*    ./configure
*    make
Under root permissions
*    make install

4: Installing Pybel module is needed to bind Python with OpenBabel :

*    cd scripts/python
*    python setup.py build
Under root permissions
*    python setup.py install

WARNING:
If you are running X86_64bits architecture machine you must edit the file /usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/openbabel.py
and replace the line "import dl" with "import DLFCN as dl"

5: X-Score (Optional).
If your compound library exceeds 10.000 molecules, you will need to install the X-Score package as follow (this is to compute XLogP
values for a large collection, the default tool implemented in OpenBabel has a bug, this will be solved soon, in any case, X-score is a
must to have. After registration, you can download the software, put it in the
"extras" directory and install it as follow.

*    tar -xvzf xscore.tar.gz
*    cd xscore_v1.2.1/c++/
*    make
*    cp xscore ../bin/

NOTES:
-	If you are going to use X-Score toolkit, please check that in the file <faf2.param> you have switched the xscore flag to "on"
-	You need to place your license agreement file in your home directory.
 

6: GnuPlot (Optional).
After downloading GnuPlot 4.2.3, put it in the "extras" directory and install it as follow:

*    tar -xvzf gnuplot-4.2.3.tar.gz
*    cd gnuplot-4.2.3
*    ./configure
*    make
Under root permissions
*    make install

NOTE:
-	If you are going to use the GnuPlot toolkit, check that in the file <faf2.param> (see parameters files section) you have switched
the gnuplot flag to "on".
-	Check if png libraries used in gnuplot are installed on your Operating System, maybe it could be a reason of problem during
generation of histograms 


7: Setting the environment variables.
Edit your ".bashrc" (or ".cshrc") and add these lines (example for bash shell, please check the internet for additional explanations
or for C shell equivalent):

-	OpenBabel

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
for ".cshrc" :
setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib

-	X-Score

export XTOOLS_HOME=$XTOOLS_HOME:"FAFDrugs2 path install"
 for instance on my machine I have:
 export XTOOLS_HOME=$XTOOLS_HOME:/home/david/FAFDrugs2/extras/xscore_v1.2.1
export XTOOLS_PARAMETERS=$XTOOLS_HOME/parameters
export XTOOLS_BIN=$XTOOLS_HOME/bin


or to your ".cshrc":
setenv XTOOL_HOME   the_installation_directory_of_X-Score
for instance XTOOL_HOME  /home/david/FAFDrugs2/extras/xscore_v1.2.1
setenv XTOOL_PARAMETER  $XTOOL_HOME/parameter
setenv XTOOL_BIN  $XTOOL_HOME/bin
set path = ($path  $XTOOL_BIN)


Add the executable path for X-Score and FAFDrugs2 to your searching PATH, for instance I have in my ".bashrc" searching PATH:

PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin:/home/david/FAFDrugs2/extras/xscore_v1.2.1/bin:/home/david/FAFDrugs2/bin:
export PATH
